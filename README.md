# react-todo-takehome-challenge

## Description
In the project directory, run: <br>
```npm install ``` <br>
``` npm start ```

This will run the app in development mode. Open localhost:3000 to view in browser.

As described in the [project description](https://user-interviews.notion.site/React-take-home-challenge-Public-fc404659353745de84fa54bce5031a96), this is a basic to-do app. High priority items in addition to a few nice-to-haves have been implemented here! 

## Implemented Features 

##### High Priority features 
- Edit todos 
- Mark todo as done 
- Set due dates for todos 
- Highlight todo when it's overdue 

##### Additional features 
- Set high, medium, low priority for todos
- Todos persist in localstorage  
- Duplicate Todos 
- Clear all existing todos
- Sort todos by priority level or date 
- Updated UI

## Future Features 

There are a good amount of features we could develop in the future; for instance: 
- Batch operations 
- Dragging todos around to reorder them 
- Searching todos by text 
- Attaching photos/adding links to todos
